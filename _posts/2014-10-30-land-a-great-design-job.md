<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Reading this article will not magically guarantee you a design job. Like most things in life, there’s no secret formula to success. Landing a great job in any field requires a lot of hard work, a little luck, and, often, good connections. This article focuses more on the application and interview processes than the steps it takes to find a design job you will love or become a better designer. If you’re interested in something along those lines, check out the recommended reading links at the bottom of this article.</em></p>

<h3>The basics</h3>

<p>Do your research, tailor your application, and always follow up.</p>

<p>When you apply for a design position, do you spend less than 20 minutes researching the company you’re applying for? Do you spend even less time tailoring your cover letter? Do you often address your cover letters to nameless people – e.g. “Dear Hiring Manager,” “Dear Sir/Madam,” etc? Do you seldom write follow up e-mails? If you answered “yes” to any of these questions, you’re already doing it wrong. Please bookmark this post and go read articles on job application basics: e.g.“How to write a cover letter that gets you a job.”</p>

<h3>The cover letter</h3>
<p>Remember that the best cover letters address two basic problems.</p>

<h4>Problem 1:</h4>
<p>The potential employer needs to know you are the best fit for their team’s current needs.</p>

<h4>Problem 2:</h4>

<p>The potential employer wants to know you care and are excited about their team, specifically.</p>

<p>Make it easy for the potential employer. In your intro e-mail (the cover letter), explain, as briefly as possible, how you meet the key criteria mentioned in the job post. Impress the potential employer by making it clear you’ve carefully researched and are excited about the possibility of working with their team. Get creative, here. Mention blog posts written by the staff. Talk about some feature in the company’s app or on its website you think is amazing. Basically, show them you’re willing to go the extra mile just to get an interview. If you want to make their jaws drop, tell them you’d love to learn more about the problems they are facing.</p>

<p>Also, make sure you kick off your cover letter with a hook. Here are a couple of real intros that recently got my attention:</p>

<p>“I graduated from X School with a Bachelors in Graphic Design in 20XX (3,000 applied, 30 got in, and only 19 of us graduated on time).”</p>

<p>“I am seeking an opportunity to really dive into a full-time design career. I have been searching hard for an open door to have the chance to show that I have the guts of a great designer.”</p>

<h3>The portfolio</h3>

<p>Always approach your portfolio as a design problem.</p>

<p>Imagine you are an employer. When you look at a candidate’s portfolio, you are seeking to determine if the individual’s experience and skills are a great match for your team’s current needs. As a candidate, you need to make sure your portfolio directly addresses those issues.</p>

<p>For instance, if you are applying for an app designer position, you should tailor your portfolio (and cover letter) so it emphasizes your experience with and love for app design. If a potential employer visits your web portfolio, they should immediately be greeted by your amazing app design examples – even if you only have a couple. Never make a potential employer search through a large portfolio to find relevant examples. Don’t bury what you want them to see. Hand it to them.</p>

<p>An easy way to accomplish this is to include a couple of links in your intro e-mail to your best and most relevant design work. You can also attach a customized PDF portfolio that contains more examples of your best and most relevant portfolio pieces.</p>

<p>When you create a PDF or web portfolio, anticipate what a potential employer might want to know. Always write about the design process for each piece. Explain why, how, and when you created each work. Be succinct. Don’t write a novel. If you don’t list this additional info, how will a potential employer know what they are looking at? The extra PDF portfolio is especially helpful to potential employers when your web portfolio contains examples of design work not directly related to the position for which you are applying.</p>

<p>The best portfolios I’ve seen usually have the following qualities:</p>

<h4>The quality > volume.</h4>

<p>You should only showcase the very best examples of your work. No employer needs to see every CD cover and flyer you have ever designed. …Actually, while we’re on the subject, please go remove all those CD covers from your portfolio right now. Trust me, they won’t help you land the job you really want.</p>

<h4>Relevant portfolio pieces are showcased.</h4>

<p>The design examples you choose to showcase should almost all be directly related to the type of position you are seeking. If you are applying for a UX design position and most of your portfolio pieces are examples of UX work, it makes the employer’s job much easier.</p>

<h4>I can quickly find what I’m looking for.</h4>

<p>Your design examples should be logically grouped. If you mainly identify as a particular type of designer – e.g. UX – you can simply group your portfolio pieces by client project. E.g. www.bryanfreeland.com/ If you want to emphasize that you have broad design expertise, you can divide your portfolio into categories like “graphic design,” “product design,” “web/app design,” etc. Within these categories, you can place your examples of individual client projects (e.g. Product Design > Client A, Client B).</p>

<h4>The design process is explained.</h4>
<p>Succinctly explain why, how, and when you created each work. A few sentences is plenty. If you’re applying for a UX position, keep in mind that each portfolio piece should tell a story.</p>

<h4>The layout works well on mobile.</h4>
<p>Chances are high that at least one potential employer is going to check out your portfolio on his or her mobile phone. And, if you’re applying for a position that involves mobile and/or app design, what kind of message does it send to the employer if your portfolio isn’t mobile friendly?</p>

<h3>The interview</h3>

<p>Keep in mind that most interviewers are trying to answer a handful of key questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What drives this candidate? / What is this candidate passionate about?</li>
	<li>How successful has this candidate been in the past?</li>
	<li>Does this person have the technical competence we need them to possess?</li>
	<li>How does this candidate think through problems?</li>
	<li>Is this person a good fit for our office culture?</li>
</ul>	

<h4>Whenever possible, tell engaging stories.</h4>
<p>Vague, general answers seldom reveal a candidate’s competence and personality. You need to talk about specific projects, specific challenges, and specific triumphs. Be compelling! If your passion for your own stories isn’t evident, how can you expect the interviewer to get excited about them?</p>

<h4>Get the interviewer talking.</h4>
<p>Find out the key problems that the team is facing. Then ask questions that reveal “you understand their wants and needs.”</p>

<h4>Show initiative.</h4>
<p>Look for opportunities to show your curiosity about and passion for design during the interview. Let me give you an example. During a recent round of designer interviews I led, a number of the applicants couldn’t answer a specific technical question about a software program. When I explained the answer to each interviewee, the standard response was a head nod and silence before the next question. Only one designer broke the mold. Instead of doing the silent nod response, he said, “Wow, that’s really cool. I wish I had known about this sooner.” He then wrote down some notes about the feature. I was impressed.</p>

<h3>The follow-up email</h3>

<p>Always always send thank you e-mails.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, most candidates don’t send any follow-up e-mails. The applicants who take a couple of minutes to write a thank you e-mail definitely stand out. The best follow-up e-mails I’ve received mention something the candidate and I discussed on the phone or in person. It’s also great when the candidate shows excitement for the team and position.</p>

<h3>The extra mile</h3>

<p>Follow the company/team on Twitter and LinkedIn when you submit your application. This shows that you are really interested in their company, in their team.</p>
Keep a design blog (you can even write on sites like Medium). Blog about cool projects you’re working on. Write about the type-faces you love and hate. Tell engaging stories. Show that your passion for design extends beyond your 9–5.</p>
