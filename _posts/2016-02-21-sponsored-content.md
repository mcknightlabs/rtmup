<p>Like most media companies, <a href="http://industrydive.com/">Industry Dive</a> draws a clear line in the sand between editorial and sponsored content. There's a well-understood separation of church and state.</p>

<p>This makes content branding particularly important, as well as tricky. It means our design team must find a way to use signposts – logos, colors, copy, etc. – to help users recognize different content types.</p>

<p>Step one should be obvious. We need to figure out what content types a user might encounter.</p>

<p>Here's my list for Industry Dive:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Editorial content</li>
	<li>Editorial content that is aligned with, but not influenced by, a particular client</li>
	<li>Content produced by or for a client through our <a href="http://www.industrydive.com/brandstudio/">Brand Studio</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Step two is to draw the line in the sand – to signpost in a way that helps the user understand if the content is A) independently produced by our editorial team or B) influenced in any way by a sponsor.</p>

<p>Let's look at the content types one by one.</p>

<h3>1. Editorial content</h3>
<p>This one is the most straightforward. Editorial content always appears on a page with our main publication logo, a red Dive "D." Also present is a byline with the staffer name. Nothing unique here.</p>

<h3>2. Editorial content that is aligned with, but not influenced by, a particular client.</h3>
<p>This one is a bit more difficult and varies depending upon the product.</p>

<p><strong>Take our industry surveys, for instance.</strong> They are editorial pieces, uninfluenced by our clients. However, some of our clients want to align their brands with this type of content.<p>

<p>To make these nuances clear to readers, we use three signposts:</p>

<ol>
	<li>On the cover, we include our publication logo – the editorial logo.</li>
	<li>On the cover, we include the client logo with the words "in association with."</li>
	<li>On the first page of the survey, the executive summary, we include the following copy: "The survey was sponsored by client X. The sponsor had no influence over the content in this report."</li>
</ol>

		<img src="{{ site.url }}/media/img/branding/seu_exec.jpg" class="img-border">
		</figure>
	</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Here's another example. A webinar.</strong> Although some of our webinars have a lot of editorial content, all are sponsored and can be influenced by the client.</p>

<p>When thinking about webinar branding, our design team has to consider three different cases:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Promotional materials</li>
	<li>Landing page</li>
	<li>Webinar slide deck</li>
</ol>

<p>1) Promotional materials normally consist of an email blast, a promotional message in our daily email newsletter, and display ads on our publication site. In each case, we describe the event as an "X Dive" webinar and include the sponsor logo with the words "sponsored by."</p>

<p>2) Webinar landing pages are a little more complex. In particular, we need to ensure that the design accomplishes the following goals:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If someone lands on this page, whether from our site or a shared link from a colleague, she should recognize that the webinar is associated with "X Dive."</li>
	<li>All users should be aware that the webinar is sponsored content and know the identity of that sponsor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, we placed our Dive Brand Studio logo at the top of the webinar landing page. We did this to emphasize that the webinar is sponsored, not editorial, content.</p>

<figure>
<img src="{{ site.url }}/media/img/branding/lp_old.jpg" class="img-border">
</figure>


<p>Unfortunately, this approach wasn't effective in addressing the first goal listed above. Because all "Utility Dive" branding was absent, we realized that a user might not understand that the webinar is affiliated with the publication.</p>

<p>Our solution was to replace the Brand Studio logo with our main publication one. To make it clear to the user that the content is sponsored, we added the sponsor logo, company name, and the words "webinar sponsor" directly between our publication logo and the webinar title. We wanted to place the branding in a "can't miss" spot to ensure that the reader understands that this is sponsored, not editorial content.</p>

<p>3) Moving on to the slide deck branding. This is pretty simple. Alongside our publication logo, we include the client logo, accompanied by the words "sponsored by."</p>

<h3>3. Content produced by or for a client through our Brand Studio</h3>

<p>We have a couple products to consider here.</p>
<p><strong>Playbooks.</strong> These are often articles on industry trends or popular topics written by freelancers contracted through our Brand Studio. The client gets to pick the topic and has editorial oversight over the copy, design, etc. After an article is written, our design team packages it as a slick-looking PDF (yes, PDFs suck on small screens, but they are easy to gate and use for lead collection).</p>
<p>Because playbooks are completely controlled by the client, we use our Brand Studio logo and client logo on the cover. We include the title of our publication – e.g. Utility Dive – only in text.</p>
<p>Each playbook also ends with a dedicated client call-to-action page.</p>

		<img src="{{ site.url }}/media/img/branding/ibm_playbook_cta.jpg" class="img-border">
		</figure>
	</div>
</div>


<p><strong>Sponsored articles.</strong> These are articles written by either our client or freelancers contracted through our Brand Studio team. The client has editorial control.</p>
<p>To make it clear that the article is sponsored, we include a bright blue "sponsored article" label above the headline. Right before the copy, we also include the words "sponsored content produced by" alongside the sponsor logo.</p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="medium-6 columns">
		<figure>
		<img src="{{ site.url }}/media/img/branding/fooddive_sponsored_article.jpg" class="img-border">

		<img src="{{ site.url }}/media/img/branding/fooddive_sponsored_article2.jpg" class="img-border">
		</figure>
	</div>
</div>

<p>Whew. And that was just an overview of the most common branding issues I face. There are plenty of outliers.</p>

<p>As with other areas of design, I am constantly refining and experimenting with branding strategies. I am sure there are more effective ways of addressing the problems and goals discussed in this article. Any and all feedback is welcome.</p>

<p>In a future post, I'll take a look at how other publications are approaching sponsored content branding.</p>
