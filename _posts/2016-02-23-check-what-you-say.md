<p>In recent years, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/brief-history-of-the-demise-of-the-comments-timeline/">a lot of publishers have removed their comment sections</a>. The reasons make sense. Comment sections are huge management burdens. At a minimum, someone has to spend hours culling the cruft – spam, bots, product/personal promotion, ad hominem attacks, etc. For a comment section to have any real value, someone also needs to call out top comments and respond to users.<p>

<p>Earlier today, I was talking with a coworker about ways to reduce that management burden and boost the overall quality of user responses.</p>

<p>Metafilter came up. The site takes a 3-pronged approach to community management.</p>

<ol>
	<li>New users must pay a one-time $5 fee to join.</li>
	<li>New users must wait one week after signing up "to post a new question to Ask MetaFilter or a new post to MetaFilter." However, a user can immediately comment and answer questions.</li>
	<li>All comments are moderated. On the site's <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/newuser.mefi">membership page</a> is the following warning: "If you sign up an account to pimp your product, act like an ass, or generally just do things that break the guidelines you will be booted and there will be no refunds."</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The $5 payment seems like a great idea. The small barrier to entry reduces – but does not eliminate – the frequency of bots, people signing up for multiple accounts to spam, etc.</p>

<p>This "pay-to-post" approach is something publishers could experiment with. Moderation would still be required, though.</p>

<p>On top of a small payment, a publisher might want to require a social login. In theory, it forces the user to take personal responsibility for the statements they make. A lot of sites already have social integration but don't pair it with a pay requirement. Without the latter, you get a lot of users posting with bogus social accounts. Tons of spam.</p>

<p>But "pay-to-post" isn't the only interesting approach out there.</p>

<p>Andrew Sullivan, for instance, <a href="http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2012/03/16/the-end-of-comments/">only accepted email feedback</a> on his blog posts. He then edited and re-posted the best of the responses.</p>

<p>Sullivan's approach might be a better bet for publishers. Three reasons.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The publisher doesn't have to pay someone to manage a public comment section. That said, there's obviously still a time cost for the person sifting through the feedback emails.</li>
	<li>Editors have the opportunity to add insight to already insightful comments and publish them as new content. This can produce more traffic, more ad impressions, etc. It's also likely users will look forward to reading these type of pieces.</li>
	<li>There's a chance that comments affect how users perceive a publisher's content. For more on this, read <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/internet-comments-and-perceptions-of-quality/371862/">Adam Felder's article</a> in <em>The Atlantic</em>. He describes a Mechanical Turk A/B test he ran using article clips with and without comments attached.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are plenty of other approaches to online community management, but I'll explore them in future posts.
