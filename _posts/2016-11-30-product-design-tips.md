<h3>1. Focus on UX before UI.</h3>

<p>It's important to nail down user experience details like functional requirements and user flows before jumping into the design of the interface. The UX should always determine the UI.</p>

<h3>2. Use disposable wireframes.</h3>

<p>When designing both the UX and UI of a product, I often start with either a whiteboard or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JN7U">post-it-notes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Whiteboard approach:</strong> If using a whiteboard, I draw out a row of boxes to represent different steps in a user flow or specific interactions. I include arrows to illustrate direction of flow or action.</p>

<p><strong>Post-it-notes approach:</strong> I use notes that are about the same size as a mobile device screen. Each note represents a different step in a user flow or specific interaction. E.g. Home > topic page > article page > article page + open mobile menu.</p>

<blockquote>"Paper wireframes are quick to make and reinforce that ideas are cheap and safe to throw away. Paper, also allows anyone on the team to take part in wireframing. By using paper, we avoid confusing well-designed wireframes for good ideas." <citation>– "<a href="https://medium.com/@dustin/how-to-get-value-from-wireframes-f40c2cf27960#.ymf43wtnc">How to get value from wireframes</a>" (written by former design lead at Medium)</citation></blockquote>

<p>After the post-it-note process, I usually jump to building high-fidelity, yet still easily malleable, mockups in Keynote. I learned this approach from Google Ventures – "<a href="https://library.gv.com/paper-prototyping-is-a-waste-of-time-353076395187#.4x40uk8ml">Paper prototyping is a waste of time: Design on paper but always test with a screen</a>."</p>

<p>Using paper/whiteboard and Keynote, rather than a pixel-perfect tool like Photoshop, ensures I never become attached to my designs. They are quick to make and, therefore, disposable.</p>

<h3>3. Don't design for you. Design for your users.</h3>

<p>In design, like in life, it's easy to charge ahead without questioning your beliefs and emotions. Going with this gut-based approach means you'll likely design the product so it looks good and works well for *you.* Hell, it might look great to everyone in your office. But is your design optimized for your users? Often, the answer is no. If you want to improve your product for your users, you need to constantly question your design decisions. You should be able to back up your choices with user-centric logic and, whenever possible, user data.</p>

<blockquote>"The main point I want to make is that you, dear reader, are almost certainly in the top category of computer skills, level 3. In the United States, only 5% of the population has these high computer skills."<citation>– "<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels/">The Distribution of Users’ Computer Skills: Worse Than You Think</a>" (written by Jakob Nielsen, co-founder of Nielsen Norman Group)</citation></blockquote>

<h3>4. Pay attention to the relationship between data and design.</h3>

<p>Delving into the user data can reveal a lot of hidden UX friction points.</p>

<blockquote>"We can use metrics to drive us, to eliminate where frustration’s coming from and figure out how to deliver delight by having the right scales." <citation>– "<a href="https://www.uie.com/jared-live/transcripts/Is_Design_Metrically_Opposed.html">Is Design Metrically Opposed?</a>" (written by Jared Spool)</citation></blockquote>

<h3>5. Read widely and constantly.</h3>
