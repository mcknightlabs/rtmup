<p>"People are carrying around a portable dopamine pump." – David Greenfield, assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine and founder of The Center for Internet and Technology Addiction.</p>

<p>You sign off one site. You delete one app. But where do you deposit your saved time? Probably somewhere else online. This has become the norm for most of us. We are caught in a web <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/2012/07/the-art-of-manipulation.html">designed to keep us there</a>.</p>

<p>But there's another type of "normal" life we can choose to live.</p>

<blockquote>
As the world becomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can live a normal life will be driven ever further apart. One sense of "normal" is statistically normal: what everyone else does. The other is the sense we mean when we talk about the normal operating range of a piece of machinery: what works best. These two senses are already quite far apart. Already someone trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of the US. That phenomenon is only going to become more pronounced. You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if people don't think you're weird, you're living badly.
<citation>– Paul Graham, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html">"The Acceleration of Addictiveness"</a> 2010</citation>
</blockquote>

<p>Graham's overall argument is that a life well-lived is one devoid of digital addiction.  You are obviously free to disagree – we are each entitled to our own beliefs about what the "good life" looks like – but why would you?</p>

<p>Think about what lies down the path of digital addiction.</p>

<p>Louis C.K. describes it well – “You never feel completely sad or completely happy, you just feel … kinda satisfied with your products. And then you die."</p>

<p>Avoiding this addiction doesn't require you to avoid all technology. It doesn't require you to rail against the modern world and its growing number of conveniences.</p>

<p>It simply means that you recognize technology's double-edged nature and retain the healthy ability to say no – the ability to <em>not</em> take certain actions.</p>

<blockquote>
Few of us want these technologies banned or regulated by ham-fisted government officials. These tools connect us to each other and make life more enjoyable. We live in a tremendous age of technological advancement but as Sophocles said over 2,000 years ago, “nothing vast enters the lives of mortals without a curse.” The Internet is indeed something vast. Now it’s up to us to figure out how to deal with the downsides of these technologies while enjoying their benefits.

<p>What kind of normal life will you live?</p>


<!--

<p>Offline emotions run deeper. – "For if there is no dark night of the soul anymore that isn’t lit with the flicker of the screen, then there is no morning of hopefulness either."</p>


<p>There are a lot of heuristics.</p>

<p>You can ask yourself the following questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If I could only be remembered for how I lived my life on a single day, what would I do? How would I choose to fill those hours?</li>
</ul>

<p>Would you spend it Snapping? Browsing Facebook? Watching Netflix? Checking email?</p>


<p>We could blame the social media companies for this addiction. And the dealers are somewhat culpable. ...They shape social norms.</p>

But so are you, the user.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you control your thoughts and actions.</p>

<p>Your life online is superficial. Once in a while, 

<p>What does addiction look like? you are probably addicted.</p>



<ul>
	<li>Unplug from all social media, except chat apps. You don't need other people to like your thoughts, photos, or vacations.</li>
	<li>Be okay with silence.</li>

 
<p>"I treat every patient as the most important patient I have ever had."</p>



If you are excited about something, find someone else who is and share it with them.

The richest moments in life are ones spent enjoying company of other people – of family, friends, and strangers. Standing around in a group with phones in hand is not...

Go outside.

<p>Life is not to be lived online.</p>







Just because technology makes life simpler, it doesn't n.</p>

<p>As I stand on the metro platform.

<p>Is time spent checking your phone time well spent?</p>


How many of those 24 hours would you spend checking your phone?

<p>Are most apps designed to make you addicted?</p>

<p>My job is to design for the web.</p>

<p>Simplicity dulls the mind.</p>

<p>I also believe that most are designed to make you addicted.</p>

most websites and apps are not life affirming.
