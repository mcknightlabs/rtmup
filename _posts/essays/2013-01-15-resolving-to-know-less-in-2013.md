<p><em>First published on <a href="http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/15/01/2013/resolving-know-less-2013">The Global Policy Journal.</a></em></p>

<p class="first-letter">A Trappist monk once remarked, 'How deluded we sometimes are by the clear notions we get out of books. They make us think that we really understand things of which we have no practical knowledge at all.' Of course, we could easily replace 'books' with any number of other sources of information - newspapers, websites, television channels, friends . . . even professional journals. While we may ascribe greater or lesser degrees of credibility to specific information sources, none are wholly objective or immune to criticism.</p>

<p>The point is clear – whatever the source, our ‘knowledge’ is laced with multiple dimensions of uncertainty. Although most of us share this recognition, we do not always pay attention to the variation in our reactions to uncertainty, nor to how these differences shape the research and policy we create. Moreover, we often erroneously believe traditional positivist ‘science’ can provide us with hard ‘proof’ and serve as a panacea for the uncertainty we encounter in the policymaking process.</p>

<h3>What is the origin of our ‘uncertainty’?</h3>

<p>As recognised by Schneider and Kuntz-Duriseti, uncertainty is generated in several ways <a href="http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/Ch02ClimatePolicy.pdf">(2001, 55)</a>. For one, uncertainty can arise from a 'lack of information'. Indeed, we currently lack the data that would allow us to ‘know’ the myriad, geographically specific ways in which complex environmental phenomenon such as global warming will affect the world’s societies in the coming decades. Uncertainty also appears when we argue over 'what is known'. Take, for example, the World Bank-Robert Wade debates over the interpretation of existing global poverty and inequality data. In part, such disagreements bubble up from even deeper currents of uncertainty (e.g. methodological issues, such as <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21566691-government-sets-out-redefine-what-it-means-be-poor-end-line">the definition of ‘poverty’</a>). A third source of uncertainty are our disputes concerning 'what is . . . even knowable'. Consider this: can we ever ‘know’ who is right and wrong in the Global Ethics debates? Can we truly ‘know’ whether it is best to apply Cosmopolitan or Communitarian logic when addressing a given global policy issue?

<h3>Four common types of reactions</h3>

<p>Sometimes, we react to uncertainty by ignoring it. For instance, a policymaker might craft policy based upon his or her normative values while refusing to reflect upon the inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of those beliefs. A second reaction is inaction. Rather than invest in climate change mitigation and adaptation or regulate GMOs, the policymaker points to the uncertainty of empirical data and claims there is not enough evidence or ‘proof’ to support the creation of preemptive policy. A third reaction is to attempt to reduce uncertainty by gathering more evidence, more data. This reaction most closely mirrors how scientific researchers approach uncertainty. Finally, a fourth reaction is to preemptively manage uncertainty. In environmental governance, this fourth reaction famously manifests itself as the precautionary principle. That is, when the effects (of climate change, GMO usage, etc.) are unclear, policymakers err on the side of caution and draft policy under the assumption that the risks of inaction outweigh the costs of action.</p>

<h3>Is ‘science’ the remedy for uncertainty?</h3>

<p>Labels such as ‘science-based’ and ‘scientifically-informed’ are sometimes applied to policy. Almost by default, we associate ‘science’ with objectivity, with reality. And, as a result of this association, we are inclined to fall into the trap of assuming science grants us the ability to ground policy in indisputable facts, proofs, or truth. This assumption, however, should be carefully examined. Indeed, as Oreskes reminds us, '. . . the idea that science ever could provide proof upon which to base policy is a misunderstanding (or misrepresentation) of science. . . . science does not produce logically indisputable proofs about the natural world. . . . At best it produces a robust consensus based on a process of inquiry that allows for continued scrutiny, re-examination, and revision' <a href="http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/ccallender/index_files/Phil%20148/oreskes.proof%20and%20policy.pdf">(2004, 369)</a>. Science cannot serve as a panacea for uncertainty because it is nothing more nor less than a process – of constant hypothesising, questioning, and adaption. The belief that ‘science-based policy’ refers to policy solely comprised of an underlying framework of facts is naïve and, when the stakes are high enough, dangerous.</p>

<h3>How should policymakers react?</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most prudent reaction to uncertainty a policymaker can make is to identify its source and pay careful attention to the ways in which other policymakers, researchers, and the general public respond. The main advantage of reflecting upon the origin of uncertainty is that the deliberation process allows a policymaker to better gauge the risks and benefits of adopting a particular response. Examining the reactions of others is similarly valuable as it enables a policymaker to recognise when <a href="http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/02/12/2012/policymaking-dark-city-analysis">dominant policy narratives</a>, initially utilised to manage or reduce uncertainty, should be reassessed, adapted, or replaced. Finally, regardless of a policymaker’s reaction preference, he or she should remain wary of relying too heavily on science to provide indisputable proof for decision-making purposes.</p>
