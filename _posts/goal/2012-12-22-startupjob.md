While researching Internet governance during grad school at LSE, I came across the backstories of high-achieving startup founders like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. I was awestruck and inspired; it seemed like these people were actually moving the needle, creating meaningful change.

I wanted in. I wanted to help build something of value. 

As I prepared for my final exams, I started applying for various tech and design positions in DC and LA.

None of my initial leads panned out, and I returned to North Carolina when my lease expired in London.

To save money while continuing my job search, I stayed with my parents for a couple of months.

My family didn't have any startup connections, so I simply searched the big job boards – Monster, Indeed, etc. I looked for positions I thought were a good fit and sent out emails into that great darkness.

One of the startups I cold contacted was Industry Dive, a DC-based B2B media company that was searching for a marketing intern.

Although I lacked a marketing background, I knew I was overqualified for the position and could sell my enthusiasm.

I had also spent a good deal of time updating my design portfolio website which I believed would give me an edge.

Five hours after I emailed him a tailored cover letter and resume, the COO, Ryan Willumson, replied to my message. He asked to set up a brief phone interview.

We talked two days later, and it apparently went pretty well.

The day after the call, Willumson invited me to join the Industry Dive team for the next ten weeks.

I accepted. It was a foot in the door at a startup, and I was thrilled.

As the internship start date neared, I drove up to Baltimore to stay with one of my undergrad roommates. I crashed on his couch for a couple of nights, driving to DC at 6am each morning to look at sixth-month sublets. With only an internship secured, a grad school loan to repay, and dwindling savings, I couldn't afford a longer lease.

After viewing about a dozen rooms in and around DC, I joined a four person group house in Alexandria. It was over an hour and fifteen minute commute to the office by public transit, but it worked well financially. I had saved just enough money from a job I held during grad school to cover the security deposit and first two months of rent.

A few weeks into the internship, the founders approached me about the possibility of a full-time position. They told me to come back to them with a salary number by the end of the week.

I was ecstatic.

Not wanting to lose this opportunity, I low-balled the salary number – or so I thought. The founders counter-offered. The counter was low enough, in fact, that I felt I had to move on. I told them that I appreciated the offer, but I would continue to look for a full-time position elsewhere.

A few days later, the founders surprised me again by reversing position. They said they were prepared to match my original ask – $25 per hour (~ $42,000/year).

On January 8th, 2013, I signed a six-month contract. 

I was in. 

At tweny-three, I had become a startup employee.
