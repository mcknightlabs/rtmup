Back in September 2015, I decided to learn to shoot film.

I had shot on disposables as a kid, but I had never learned to use an SLR.

After researching various entry-level cameras, I pulled up Craigslist and found someone nearby selling a Canon AE-1 for $50. 

I bought it.

A few weeks later, after a good deal of article reading and YouTube tutorial watching, I received an email with a link to my first set of scans from the lab.

After sharing some of these photos with a friend from film school, he told me to try out medium-format – 120mm. It was a much bigger financial investment than the Canon, but I wanted to keep pushing my photography skills. The next week, I went on eBay and bought a Mamiya 6.

Soon after purchasing it, the Mamiya stopped working. I quickly deduced that the shutter curtain and another part were getting jammed. Using diagrams of the camera I found online, I dismantled it, fixed the jam, and put all of the parts back together.

## How to Get Started Yourself

### Good camera: 
Canon AE-1 (about $50 on Craigslist)

### Good film: 
<a href="https://www.adorama.com/kkp40036pp.html?gclid=CMeO6o2N4NECFQKHswodaaMGrw">Kodak Portra 400</a> (~$5-7 per roll)

### Good lab:
<a href="http://indiefilmlab.com/">Indie Film Lab</a> ($10 for developing each roll // scans delivered as JPGs via zip file)

### How to shoot:

1. After you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4NIiXb6dQ4">load a new roll</a>, set the ASA number on your camera to match the speed of your film – e.g. if the film speed is 400, set the ASA to 400. The ASA tells you how sensitive the film is to light. Low speeds – e.g. 50 and 100 – are great for bright days outside. High speeds – e.g. 800 – are great for low light environments. Also keep in mind that higher speed films will be more contrasty than lower ones.

2. Set your shutter no lower than 1/125th of a second, unless you plan to use a tripod. Otherwise, you'll get motion blur from the camera shaking. I usually keep mine at 1/125th, unless I'm shooting fast action – then I usually step up to 1/250 or 1/500.

3. Each time you take a shot, check the light meter in the viewfinder for the recommended F stop.

4. When you focus, remember that the dial is set in increments of meters. If you are unsure about the focus in the viewfinder, you can always look at the dial number and see if the subject is about that distance away.

5. After you finish shooting a roll, DO NOT open the camera. First, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbGFJOrE3Q8">roll the film</a> back onto the spool. Otherwise, you'll expose the film to light and ruin all of your photos (I've done this before).
