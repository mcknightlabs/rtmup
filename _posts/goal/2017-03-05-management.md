**NOTE:** This post captures my evolution as a manager from Nov. 2014 – March 2017. 

<hr>

More sleep. A real vacation. Less stress. That's what management meant to me in November 2014.

When I first became a manager, it was out of necessity. I needed help. At the time, I was the only designer at Industry Dive, a B2B media <a href="http://joel.is/your-startup-is-a-rocket-ship/">rocket ship</a>, and the projects were hitting my inbox faster than I could read the requests. So I made my first hire, and my quality of life improved.

Over the next few years, the pace of growth at the company did not change – we continued to see huge sales and personnel gains – but my view of management continuously evolved.

The transactional perspective with which I began shifted to a focus on individual and team development.

Sure, being able to effectively delegate and oversee a bunch of tasks and projects is important. But that is all transactional, and, in my mind, not good enough. Just knocking out lots of "wins" for the company has never made me feel like a great manager.

The only time I have felt like a great manager was when I led others in such a way that I earned my own respect.

These were times when I felt I exhibited temperance, self-awareness, and successfully prioritized the interests of others over my own. 

Consistently living out these qualities is obviously difficult and something with which I continually struggle. There are no shortcuts. It takes a lot of mental effort.

Below are a few questions I have used over the years to self-assess and reflect on ways I can improve.

### Am I letting personal problems influence how I treat my work and team?
This is number one on my list, because I find it the most difficult.

### Am I sliding toward burnout?
I try to take a proactive approach to <a href="{% post_url tech-design/2016-08-17-burnout %}">preventing burnout</a>. To effectively lead others, I know I must first take care of myself. If I am not at the top of my game, how can I expect to inspire or guide others toward theirs?

### Am I reacting or responding?
<ul>
	<li><strong>Never react, respond.</strong> It is easy to look like a fool, damage a personal or professional relationship, or make a technical mistake if you let your emotions control your actions. A lot of variables can make this difficult: you might be tired and stressed, the other party might be frustrated or angry and already reacting, the other party might have made a careless mistake for the nth time, maybe someone – even you – messed up and you want to fix the issue ASAP. To avoid reacting, I try to <a href="https://hbr.org/tip/2017/03/quiet-your-mind-to-avoid-making-impulsive-decisions">limit my multi-tasking</a>, get adequate sleep, and pause before responding.</li>
	<li><strong>Respond quickly but not too quickly.</strong> I try to respond as soon as I can emotionally divorce myself from the issue. Sometimes I also need to wait for the other party to calm down and will literally ask myself – "Is now the best time to respond?"</li>
	<li><strong>Never assume. Start by asking questions and listening.</strong> A given problem can easily get worse if you act with an information deficit or false assumptions. I often talk to numerous stakeholders to obtain clarity on an issue.</li>
	<li><strong>Be open and direct.</strong> When responding to a serious problem or if someone is clearly upset, I tend to avoid written communication. This means I hold off on any emails, IMs, and texts. I have found that written words can be more easily misinterpreted than spoken ones. Open and direct in-person talks or a phone call are my first preference for responding to an issue. I then use an email to clarify and follow up on a verbal discussion.</li>
</ul>

### How much am I complaining?
"Ugh. I hate designing emails. I have to support five versions of Outlook!" Imagine if I made a comment like that in front of my team and then, weeks later, had to train them to do this very task and face these very issues. They are going to walk into the training session with a biased view and expect to hate any related assignment. I am setting up them and myself, as a manager, for failure. Rather than voice serious complaints in front of my team, I do my best to deal with them silently or find actual solutions.

### Have I talked negatively about colleagues?
It does not matter if the subject of the conversation is your direct report, an intern on another team, or company leadership. If someone starts to talk negatively, not just critically, about another employee at the company, I usually take one of the following courses of action: 1) Shut it down. Attempt to shift the conversation. 2) Walk away. 3) Hang around, but do not comment. Negative gossip is poison. It can kill a group's morale and eviscerate the trust others' may have placed in you as a leader.

### Am I caring without becoming too much of a friend?
I make it a point to never become close friends with anyone whom I have the ability to fire. In my mind, this is up there with wisdom like "do not date a co-worker" and "never go into business with a significant other." Sure, it works out in some cases, but you are taking a huge, unnecessary gamble. Your best intentions can blow up in your face. I have witnessed it happen. Why go down a road of potential self-sabotage when you can easily avoid it?

Building upon my own self-assessments, I have established management strategies related to two other areas – individuals and the team.

## Individual development and growth

### Hire the right people

My first priority as a manager has been to start with the best team members possible. I have worked hard to hire the people whom I thought were the best fit and pass over the "B" players.

What follows are my personal hiring guidelines.

<ul>
	<li>When interviewing, I focus on answering two main questions: 1) Does she have a history of getting shit done? 2) Is she smart? This is a tip I learned years ago from <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/">a blog post</a> by Joel Spolsky, CEO of Stack Overflow. Five full-time hires later, I can confirm that it works quite well.</li>
	<li>I hire the best people I can find who have not yet been the best – the all-stars no one yet knows. A similar approach is to hire people who are going to "<a href="https://bothsidesofthetable.com/whom-should-you-hire-at-a-startup-bc47cac70e49#.4ql9upylg">punch above their weight-class</a>." This is relatively easy to figure out if the answers to the two questions in the previous bullet are a resounding YES.</li>
	<li>Other key things I look for are relevant passions (if you are interested in this, why aren't you doing it!), communication style (why are you rambling on for fifteen minutes and talking over all of the interviewers?), cultural fit (are you going to behave like a self-interested rebel at a time when we need a strong team player?). Getting cultural fit right is <a href="http://avc.com/2017/03/cultural-differences">always critical</a>, but it is even more important if you are a startup.</li>
</ul>

### Conduct quarterly performance evals
In order for a performance evaluation to serve a useful purpose, I believe you must first have clearly defined individual, team, and company goals and performance expectations.
That is the baseline.
Once you have that baseline, you can use a performance check-in to praise good work and recommend areas for further improvement. This can also help an employee understand annual salary decisions.

At Industry Dive, our performance evals worth like this:

A direct report and a manager receive assessment sheets. The direct report self-assesses and emails the sheet to the manager. The manager fills out a similar assessment sheet about the direct report. The pair then meet for thirty minutes at a scheduled time to go over both assessments. The assessments are mainly performance focused – where are you "rocking it" and where do you need to continue to grow.

How the in-person portion of these evals are conducted is left up to each manager.

My own approach looks like this:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Assess progress on development issues from the last quarterly performance eval.</strong> Were all of those issues properly addressed? If not, what do we need to do differently this next quarter? How can I, as your manager, help?</li>
	<li><strong>Assess current development issues.</strong> I ask the employee to be specific when listing areas for improvement. Then I make sure we have planned a few practical steps she or I can take to address each issue.</li>
	<li><strong>Give praise for hard work and wins.</strong> I ask the employee to talk about key accomplishments. I then fill in any gaps and point out areas where she is doing an awesome job.</li>
	<li><strong>Assess myself.</strong> I ask the employee to list specific ways in which I can be a better manager to her.</li>
	<li><strong>Open the floor for any other questions.</strong></li>
</ul>

### Conduct quarterly individual and team growth check-ins
This is something I started in the fall of 2016. It is a coffee check-in about individual and team dynamics and growth.
It is not about performance.
By keeping the performance conversations separate, the employee and I can get out of the office and talk in a more relaxed setting. I found that team members are more open in their feedback in these casual sessions. They are not as stressed about performance and/or salary topics.
To help me conduct these check-ins and more easily compare notes between team members, I created the following set of questions:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Where are you going?</strong> The design career direction(s) in which you want to be moving</li>
	<li><strong>How will you get there?</strong> Concrete steps you can take here at Industry Dive to help you advance your design career</li>
	<li><strong>What are we doing well?</strong> Aspects of team or project workflows or dynamics you love</li>
	<li><strong>What can we do better?</strong> Aspects of team or project workflows or dynamics that are frustrating / pain points</li>
	<li><strong>How can we grow?</strong> Ways our design team can get stronger (things like competitive analyses of other design teams, book readings, events, etc.)</li>
	<li><strong>Anything else you want to talk about?</strong></li>
</ul>

After the check-in, I immediately write up what I heard in an email and send it to the team member. The email asks the employee to confirm that I heard her correctly and gives her the opportunity to add anything we might not have covered.
