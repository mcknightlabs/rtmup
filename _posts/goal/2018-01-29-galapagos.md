Diving in the Galápagos quickly became one of my top goals after <a href="{% post_url goal/2018-02-07-scubadiving %}">completing PADI Open Water and Advanced certifications</a> over Labor Day weekend in 2017.

Just before the New Year's holiday, my friend Joe and I headed south to explore the islands and <a href="{% post_url goal/2018-01-30-uwphotography %}">document the marine life</a>.

Based on our experiences, I prepared a guide to help make the trip logistics a little less daunting for others. Have questions? Feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rtmup) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rtmup/). Enjoy.

## Know before you go
* Book your hotel in advance using a site like Bookings.com. In addition to online reviews, we considered details like proximity to the main pier, restaurants, and dive shops.
* The internet speed on the islands was... the worst. Tanzania and Nepal had **much** faster wifi. It was hard to check reviews and prices for hotels, dive shops, etc. after we arrived. Plan accordingly.
* Bring US dollars; it is Ecuador's official currency. The smaller the bills, the better. You will use cash for everything, and the ATMs can be hit or miss. Cards are rarely accepted and, if they are, usually incur a 7-8% fee. We burned $1500-1800 cash per person for a two week stay. This included everything – all dives, hotels, food, ferries, taxis, tips, souvenir t-shirts, etc.

## At the airport in mainland Ecuador
* Buy a Galápagos Transit Control Card. When you arrive at the airport in Ecuador to fly to the Galápagos, you must purchase this card. There was a little booth next to the airline check-in counters selling them and inspecting bags. It cost $20 USD cash. Put it in a safe place and DO NOT lose it. An airport employee will ask to see it when you fly back from the Galápagos to the mainland.

## Upon arrival (Baltra Airport)
* The Galápagos Islands have a $100 USD cash entry fee.
* Use the restrooms at the airport. It will take 1.5hrs to get to your hotel in Puerto Ayora.
* As you exit the airport building, turn right. There are free shuttles that will take you to the ferry dock.
* The ferry ride to Santa Cruz Island lasts about 3 minutes and costs $1 cash.
* Take a taxi for ~ $20 or bus for $4 to Puerto Ayora. We took the bus. It was fine. You must negotiate for taxis.
* If you opt for the bus to Puerto Ayora, you can also take a taxi to your hotel once you arrive at the main pier. It cost me $2. Or, just walk to your hotel using Google Maps (download the area to your phone before you go).
* Puerto Ayora is pretty small. Walk around. You’ll quickly learn the main streets.

## Returning to Baltra Airport from Santa Cruz
* Do not worry about taking the bus. Just call a taxi, negotiate the ride down to ~ $20, and split it with a friend.
* The ferry from Santa Cruz to Baltra seemed to run every 30 minutes the day of our flight.

## Groceries and toiletries
* Shop around. The prices varied wildly – e.g. Agua con gas ranged from $1 to $4. Baby shampoo (aka mask defogger) ranged from $3 to $6 for the same tiny bottle.
* Puerto Ayora’s main grocery story, which sells essentials like TP, is west of the pier. There are several other shops selling similar goods scattered throughout the area.

## Meals
* There are lots of restaurants along Charles Binford Ave. On most nights, there were about 75-100 people eating at tables in the middle of the street. The atmosphere was great.
* **Galápagos Deli** – This place is great for breakfast. A tip from watching locals – save some of the bread they give you – it's a lot – and make a breakfast sandwich with it.
* **Isla Grille** – This was our go-to lunch and dinner spot. The wifi was hard to beat anywhere else on Santa Cruz. There was also a decent pizza place next door.

## Coffee (nothing amazing)
* OMG Coffee – Decent lattes and café con leches
* Isla Grille – Decent café con leches

## Diving and snorkeling pricing
The following prices are from January 2018.

* **Academy Diving** – $170 for most 2-dive trips, $120-30 for trip with 2-3 snorkels
* **Natural Selection** – $130 for 2-3 snorkels (8AM-4PM) at Pinzón. No trips offered to Isabela.
* **Galápagos Dreams Adventures** – $100 for Isabela snorkel tour (7AM-4PM). $165 for 2-dive trips. Every day.
* **Ninfa Tour** – $130 for day trip to Isabela that included snorkeling and other activities. $100 for 2-snorkel trip to Santa Fe. No diving offered.
* **Albatros Diving** – $180 for 2-dive trip to Seymour. Overall limited availability.
* **Nauti Diving** – $180 for 2-dive trip to Daphne. No snorkeling offered. Gordon rocks required 20 dives.

## Ferries on Santa Cruz
* You can purchase ferry tickets at several locations in Puerto Ayora – e.g. Cab Martus – near the main pier. The price was $30 for a 2hr ferry to Isabela (one way). The ferries to Isabela departed at 7:00AM and 2:00PM then returns 6am and 3pm. You must book the day before. Some of the ferries were also fully booked a day or two out.

**Day 8 – Wednesday**

* Ate breakfast at the Galápagos Deli – cost $8 for 2 rolls, eggs, ham+cheese, juice, and a cafe con leche.
* Lunch was a $10 chicken sandwich from Isla Grill
* In the afternoon, we grabbed lattes at OMG coffee for $3.5.
* We then paid a cab driver near the pier $40 (roundtrip) to go visit the tortoises at El Chapto. The manager at El Chapo gave us 30 minutes to wander around in exchange for $5. The driver waited for us. When we got back in the car, he offered to take us to a volcanic crater for $10 more, but we declined.

**Day 9 – Thursday**

**Day 10 – Friday**

* Took the Blue Fantasy ferry to Isabela for $30. It was a bumpy ride. Before we boarded, we had to obtain lanyards from people at the dock, in exchange for our ferry purchase receipt. 
* Cost $10 cash to enter Isabela and $1 – each way – for the water taxi to the ferry.
* Snorkeled at Isabela in the morning and afternoon. Saw a sea lion, Green Sea Turtle, and an eagle ray, but the viz was not great. Isabela was definitely the best place we visited for Marine Iguanas. 
* Overall shitty food. Santa Cruz was much better. Could not find a decent restaurant
* Taxi was $3 from our hotel to the ferry

**Day 12 – Sunday**

* Snorkeled solo at Cristóbal. We walked 20 minutes from our hostel. Saw fish and a sea lion snorkeling at Cerro Tijeretas. Good viz. Other snorkelers saw lots of turtles. 
* Near the ferry, there were lots of sea lions on the beach. 
* Amazing bakery, especially when the pastries were fresh. Great prices.

**Day 13 – Monday**

* Snorkeled and went freediving at Kicker Rock off of Cristóbal with Galápagos Cruising Muran S.A. The boat was tiny and did not include a bathroom. The trip lasted from 10:30AM - 2:30PM. We saw a pod of dolphins on the way to Kicker Rock and one hammerhead upon arrival. We also saw a few white tip sharks, a sea lion, large schools of Black-striped Salemas, and two Green Sea Turtles. At a second snorkeling spot, we saw a few sea lions and a number of fish. This was probably the best snorkeling and freediving of the entire trip.
* Took the “Andy” ferry back to Santa Cruz at 3pm.
