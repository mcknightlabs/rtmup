After earning my PADI Open Water, Advanced, and Freediving certifications in the latter half of 2017, I set a goal of visiting two of the world's top diving locations within a year.

First up was the Galápagos. I contacted one of my buddies from film school and planned a two week trip over the 2017-18 New Years holiday.

With film and photography backgrounds, we both desired to visually document our dives.

This meant I needed to learn underwater photography and purchase or rent the necessary equipment.

Hoping to travel light, my friend opted to buy a [SeaLife DC2000](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1294161-REG/sealife_sl746_dc2000_camera_pro_duo.html) combo package with a 20MP digital camera, tray, and lights. (Note: This camera turned out to be a total disaster.)

I initially thought about shooting with my Fuji XT-1, but a quick search revealed no available housings.

Inspired by watching the BBC's Blue Planet series, I started looking at new cameras capable of shooting 4K video.

On the high end of the market were setups like RED and ARRI. On the low end were DSLRs.

I knew I wanted something that had a decent dynamic range and could shoot flat color profiles. But, I was not willing to break the bank; cameras depreciate as fast as phones.

About two weeks before my trip, I came across 4K footage shot on a [Panasonic GH5](https://www.amazon.com/PANASONIC-Mirrorless-Camera-Megapixels-DC-GH5KBODY/dp/B01MZ3LQQ5). Compared to the competition under $10,000, it blew me away.

Here are a few features that stood out:

* **Fast autofocus:** Fish do not like to sit still. Forget about rack focusing underwater. Even if you wanted to try, manual focusing is not possible with most housings. Also, think about how difficult it can be to handle focusing on land; now throw in a mask and partical-filled water.
* **Records 4K in 60FPS:** The underwater world is a fast moving one. The relatively high frame rate of 60FPS means you can obtain a natural looking, slow-motion image in post-production.
* **Records a flat image profile:** A flat image profile helps you grade the footage – e.g. pull highlights or push exposure – in post-production, without it falling apart.
* **20MP sensor:** With a decent sensor, you can capture high-quality stills, in addition to video.

I decided to go all in.

I listed my XT-1 kit for sale and quickly ordered a used GH5 and wide lens.

Next, I focused on finding a housing.

That is when things got complicated.

What brand is the best? What lens will work with what housing? What additional parts – e.g. zoom ring, port, and adapter – do I need to use with a given lens? I spent a lot of hours trying to piece together a clear picture of my options. 

Underwater photography is a niche market, so there were only three brands from which I could compare and select – [Nauticam](https://www.nauticam.com/products/na-gh5-housing-for-panasonic-lumix-gh5-camera), [Aquatica](http://www.aquatica.ca/en/products_dslr_agh5.html), and [Ikelite](https://www.ikelite.com/products/200dl-underwater-housing-for-panasonic-lumix-gh5-mirrorless-micro-four-thirds-cameras).

I read a number of stories about Ikelite housings flooding and decided to write off that one.

The Nauticam housing seemed to have the best reputation, but the prices were sky high.

This left me with one option – the Aquatica.

This also turned into a problem.

When I tried to order the housing from [Backscatter](https://www.backscatter.com/), one of the leading underwater photography shops in the States, they said they were waiting on the next shipment from the manufacturer. They did not know when this would be.

No worries, I thought, I'll just go down the list. I proceeded to contact several other vendors.

No one had the housing in stock.

My next move was to contact the manufacturer in Canada.

A representative from Aquatica told me the next batch of housings was arriving from the paint shop within a few days. I offered to pay extra to have it overnighted, via Backscatter, to DC. Even with this extra expense, the overall price remained significantly cheaper than the Nauticam.

For extra peace-of-mind, I also purchased the add-on [Aquatica SURVEYOR vacuum & moisture sensor system](http://aquatica.ca/en/accessories_surveyor.html). Before entering the water, I could turn on a moisture sensor inside the housing and pump out the air to form a vacuum. If the vaccum became compromised or the moisture sensor detected water while on the dive, an audible alarm would sound and a bright red LED would flash.

I received the gear just in time – a few days before I flew out.

To test the housing, I filled the bath and submerged the unit, sans camera. Seemed fine after fifteen minutes.

Once in the Galápagos, I tested the housing again – this time at a greater depth.

Then I tried it with the GH5 inside.

**Problem 1: Spots on the dome port** 

When I checked my video clips from the first day, I quickly realized none of it was worth keeping.

A few smudges on the port had ruined every shot.

I reformatted the card, wiping all of the data, and made sure I had [Zeiss wipes](https://www.amazon.com/Zeiss-Pre-Moistened-Cleaning-Wipes-5-Inches/dp/B00UWNFRIA) for the second dive.

**Problem 2: Bubbles on the port** 

Before entering the Pacific the next morning, I thoroughly cleaned the port with a Zeiss wipe. I also poured some water mixed with baby shampoo over the dome (same as what you would use to prevent a mask from fogging). 

When I reviewed the footage later that evening, I was surprised to see tiny dots all over the port. Most of my shots were, again, unusable.

Eventually, I determined that these dots were air bubbles. To remove them, I needed to waive my hand in front of the port each time I got in the water.

**Problem 3: Poor visibility**

The biggest video quality issue of the trip was completely out of my control. On a lot of our dives, we experienced poor visibility. Que sera sera.

**Problem 4: E-stabilization**

Around day four, I discovered that the e-stabilization feature of the GH5 was causing severe distortion around the edges of some of my shots. Turning this feature off solved the issue.

**The end result**

After eliminating the smudges, bubbles, and distortion, I finally started capturing some decent imagery. Photos below. Video forth-coming.
