The belief that effort and commitment will always save the day was hammered into a lot of us from an early age. But when your expectations get crushed – and it will happen, especially if you are ambitious – how well can you adapt?

One approach to this issue is to divorce goals from expectations. 

A Navy test pilot once told me, "I don't need a light at the end of the tunnel to keep going forward." 

Others might argue that an overriding belief in success is often key to its realization – that you can will yourself to succeed. 

I once heard a Sherpa who had been to the top of Everest four times tell another climber, "There is only summit. There is no maybe. If you think 'maybe,' you will probably fail."

It is unlikely there is a best approach. What matters most is that you find your own way to remain resilient – that you find a way to endure.
