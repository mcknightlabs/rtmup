<p>When you have something special – like talented team members who believe in each other and the company's vision – never take that for granted. As with significant others, you must be proactive if you want the people you care about to hang around.</p>

<p>Founders, managers, and entry-level employees can all take steps to strengthen their team and reduce turnover.</p>

<h3>Listen over time.</h3>
<p>Make a constant effort to find out what each team member cares about and what irks them. You can't learn these things during a quarterly feedback meeting in the corner conference room or some table at Starbucks. This knowledge is only born out of genuine and routine conversations. It takes months and a lot of effort.</p>

<h3>Make it obvious you heard.</h3>
<p>When a team member tells you about some issue, some pain point, help her overcome it. Become her advocate. Fight to have that issue addressed. When a team member tells you about her professional goals, support her. Be on the lookout for opportunities related to her desires. Create opportunities, when possible.</p>

<h3>Keep the ideas flowing.</h3>
<p>As startups grow, the projects become more time consuming, the number of meetings triples, and the e-mails overflow like never before. This is normal and necessary, but these time sucks can cause serious issues with cross-team communication. If management is always buried under a mountain of work, it can be difficult for the average employee to suggest new ideas, especially ones that affect multiple departments. It's important to make the process for proposing changes and receiving feedback on a proposal simple and clear.</p>

<h3>Don't be transactional.</h3>

		<p>In your e-mails, spoken words, and actions, make your fellow team members realize you care about them as individuals.</p>

		<p>When you think you are being too transactional, let that person know. This kind of feedback means a lot to employees. During an intensely busy period of work, I received this e-mail from one of the founders of <a href="https://twitter.com/industrydive">@IndustryDive</a>.</p>

<h3>Build people up.</h3>
<p>Most of us tend to hone in on what annoys us about other people. Push those useless fucking thoughts out of your head. Focus on the best in each member of your team and find ways to call out and build up those strengths.</p>

<h3>Inspire.</h3>
<p>Don't merely complete tasks. Work toward an exciting vision of what a project or the entire company can become. Don't just think this way; talk this way. Make others want to believe in and work together to realize that future.</p>

<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>Don't have the time to do these things? Bullshit. You don't have the right perspective. Start thinking about time limitations as problems you can solve. You always have the time to do whatever you value. "Too busy" simply means you have decided to award higher priority to something else. If you value a strong team, you'll find you can get creative with your time.</p>
