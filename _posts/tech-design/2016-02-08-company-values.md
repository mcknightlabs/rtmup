<p>A lot of founders come up with a set of values for their company and hand them down to their hires. Not so at Industry Dive.</p>

<p>Instead of dictating from the top down, the co-founders deferred responsibility to a group of employees from a range of departments. It was a couple years into the company's existence when the internal branding team was formed. The leadership wanted to ensure that everyone – internally and externally – shared a consistent understanding of what Industry Dive does and cares about.</p>

<p>Over a series of working lunches, the group of employees came up with an official brand statement, mission statement, and list of core values.</p>

<p>I think the list of values, in particular, is worth highlighting.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Serve the reader. Serve the client.</li>
	<li>Solve the problems.</li>
	<li>Bring your personality.</li>
	<li>Feed your curiosity.</li>
	<li>Experiment. Learn. Repeat.</li>
	<li>Earn it.</li>
</ol>

<p>That top value is pretty unique. It’s our answer to a common business question, “Who is more important, the user or the client?” Without users, you won’t have any clients. Without clients, though, you won’t make any money and your business will fail.</p>

<p>By emphasizing to every employee – from editors to sales reps – that both the user and client are equally important, we ensure that both are always top of mind. It also helps balance fundamental interests across departments and within our company as a whole, placing equal importance on both sales and editorial.</p>
