<p>In one corner of the Twittersphere yesterday, a conversation started about what it takes to become a VC. I found the original post and a lot of the contributions interesting, so I thought I'd repost the entire thread for easy reference and reading here. Warning: it's an image. Can't easily embed a long Twitter conversation. If you want to access those hyperlinks, check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/km/status/699331671439601666">original Tweet</a>.</p>
