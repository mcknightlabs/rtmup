<p>The volume of intriguing articles that pours down my Twitter feed every day is overwhelming.</p>

<p>It gives me this urge to curate. Gotta catch 'em all! But, well, damn. That's impossible. What I can do is aggregate some of the best pieces and highlight for you and myself the parts I find most insightful.</p>

<p>Here are a few reads worth checking out:</p>

<p><strong>1. "<a href="http://themacro.com/articles/2016/02/michael-moritz-sequoia-success/">Maintaining Success for the Long Term</a>"</strong> via YC's Macro</p>

<p>How have firms like Sequoia Capital been able to remain key industry players for so long? Michael Moritz's answer isn't a long read, but, if you're short on time, check out the "Yesterday is irrelevant" and "Maintain a fresh team" sections.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"That was one of the great things about Steve Jobs, it’s one of the great things about Larry Page, it’s one of the great things about Jeff Bezos, or Reed Hastings. These are leaders who are capable of doing it. How do they do it?</p>

<p>They want to make sure that their product is fresh, that it changes with the times; that they never rest on their laurels, or get complacent; that they always have an element of insecurity about feeling that they can always get eaten by a competitor, and that past successes don’t mean all that much."</p> <citation>– Michael Moritz, Sequoia Capital</citation>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2. "<a href="http://firstround.com/review/the-magical-benefits-of-the-quitters-mindset/">Value of quitting</a>"</strong> via First Round Review</p>

<p>I've always been interested in the value of follow-through (aka "grit"). At face value, quitting seems like it must exist on the opposite end of the spectrum. A lot of times, though, you have to quit activities in one area of your life so that you can better follow through in others. Ironically, grit can compel you to quit. Keeping the value of quitting top of mind and learning how others calculate the related risks are definitely worth the effort.</p>

<p><strong>3. "<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/inside-the-artificial-intelligence-revolution-a-special-report-pt-1-20160229#ixzz41o6bt0RK">Inside the Artificial Intelligence Revolution: A Special Report, Pt. 1</a>"</strong> via Rolling Stone</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/pabbeel">Pieter Abbeel</a> on the current state of robot intelligence:</strong> "Robots don't even have the learning capabilities of a two-year-old."</li>
	<li><strong>A robot figured out how to put a peg in a hole by examining</strong> "how its body was positioned.... In effect, the robot had figured out a way on its own to correctly execute the command."</li>
	<li><strong>Comparing approaches to machine learning:</strong> "Trust Region Policy Optimization, or TRPO, achieved results almost as good as the DeepMind algorithm."</li>
	<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/aterkik">@aterkik</a> – let me know when you write this one:</strong> "In the world of AI, the Holy Grail is to discover the single algorithm that will allow machines to understand the world – the digital equivalent of the Standard Model that lets physicists explain the operations of the universe."</li>
	<li><strong>A warning about AI from physicist Stephen Hawking:</strong> "A superintelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren't aligned with ours, we're in trouble. You're probably not an evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you're in charge of a hydroelectric green-energy project and there's an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants. Let's not place humanity in the position of those ants."</li>
	<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg">Andrew Ng</a>'s view of the AI threat:</strong> "Worrying about killer robots is like worrying about overpopulation on Mars – we'll have plenty of time to figure it out."</li>
	<li><strong>Why has AI started to come of age?</strong> 1) "continued increases in computer power along with drops in prices have provided the horsepower that sophisticated AI algorithms need to function" and 2) "the arrival of big data."</li>
	<li><strong>If you work on AI (or any tech) for one reason, be prepared for others to use it in ways you never would: </strong> "technology, once it is invented, finds its own way in the world." (E.g. Yann LeCun's work in the field of computer vision is being used for mass surveillance purposes.)</li>
	<li><strong>How is Facebook using AI? Initially, to understand why people share.</strong>  "LeCun says that one of the best examples of AI at Facebook is Moments."</li>
	<li><strong>What's a key issue in AI?</strong> LeCun points to "unsupervised learning."</li>
	<li><strong>How might "unsupervised learning" be addressed?</strong> By making AI better at prediction, says LeCun.</li>
</ul>
