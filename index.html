<h1>Ryan McKnight</h1>

<p><strong>Product and design leader. Startup veteran.</strong></p>

<p>I founded and lead the <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/news/post/honoring-industry-dives-award-winning-design-leader/">award-winning</a> <a href="https://design.industrydive.com/">design team</a> at <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/">Industry Dive</a>, a rapidly growing business news company in Washington, DC. We were selected a "Best Place to Work" by the Washington Post in 2017 and 2018.

<p>In 2017, I was recognized as an "<a href="http://www.siia.net/bims/SPECIAL-PROGRAMS/Emerging-Leader-Awards">Emerging Leader</a>" in the B2B media industry for my work at Industry Dive.</p>

<p>I joined the Industry Dive team during year one and became <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/tech/2018/02/05/startupjob">FTE #5</a>. Within five years, we scaled the company to over 100 FTEs and $15M+ in revenue.</p>

<p><strong>Self-mastery is what drives me.</strong></p>

<p>I am a scuba diver, freediver, wilderness first aid responder and <a href="http://divegoals.com/uwp/2018/01/30/uwphotography.html">underwater photographer</a>. I have photographed the earth <a href="http://ryantmcknight.com/experiment/2016/06/23/hab-part-1.html">from the stratosphere</a>, marine life in the <a href="http://divegoals.com/dive/2018/01/29/galapagos.html">Gal√°pagos</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BhjlN3wjOvB/?taken-by=divegoals">shipwrecks</a> in the Red Sea. I have trekked to <a href="http://summitgoals.com/ascents/2016/11/05/everest.html">Everest Base Camp</a> and summited <a href="http://summitgoals.com/ascents/2017/01/12/kilimanjaro.html">Kilimanjaro</a> and <a href="http://summitgoals.com/ascents/2018/06/21/rainier.html">Rainier</a>.</p>
