<p><strong>Product and design leader. Startup veteran.</strong></p>

<p>I founded and lead the <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/news/post/honoring-industry-dives-award-winning-design-leader/">award-winning</a> <a href="https://design.industrydive.com/">design team</a> at <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/">Industry Dive</a>, a rapidly growing business news company in Washington, DC. We were selected a "Best Place to Work" by the Washington Post in 2017 and by the Washington Business Journal in 2015, 2016 and 2017. In 2017, I was recognized as an "<a href="http://www.siia.net/bims/SPECIAL-PROGRAMS/Emerging-Leader-Awards">Emerging Leader</a>" in the B2B media industry for my work at Industry Dive.<p>

<p><strong>Self-mastery is what drives me.</strong></p>

I have photographed the earth from the stratosphere, marine life in the Gal√°pagos and shipwrecks in the Red Sea. I have trekked to Everest Base Camp and summited Kilimanjaro.
