<h1>Ryan McKnight</h1>

<strong>Product and design leader. Startup veteran.</strong>

I founded and lead the <a href="https://design.industrydive.com/">award-winning design team</a> at <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/">Industry Dive</a>, a rapidly growing business news company in DC. We were selected as a "Best Place to Work" by the Washington Post in 2017 and by the Washington Business Journal in 2015, 2016 and 2017.

I also founded and am growing <a href="https://www.scarceart.com/">Scarce Art</a> and <a href="https://nextdesignjob.com/">Next Design Job</a>.

A lot of my work involves effectively scaling teams and processes. Read about my startup and management experiences <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/tech-design.html">here</a>.

<strong>Self-mastery is what drives me.</strong> 

I am a certified scuba diver, freediver, wilderness first aid responder and experienced underwater photographer. I have photographed the earth from the stratosphere, marine life in the Galapagos and shipwrecks in the Red Sea. I have trekked to Everest Base Camp and summited Kilimanjaro. Read more about my pursuit of goals <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/goals.html">here</a>.

<h3>Why RTMUP?</h3>

"RTM" are my initials. "UP" is my chosen perspective. Stoic philosophy teaches us that we have control over how we perceive and respond to what happens to us but not much else.

<blockquote>"In a rapidly ascending balloon were two men. One watched the earth getting farther and farther away. One watched the stars getting nearer and nearer."
<citation>- A Book Without A Title, George Jean Nathan, 1919</citation>
